1. More photos. Show myself being more genuine and involved. Ex: Robotics team, out with friends, etc.
2. Links to github
 - Develop github profile
3. Fill out the about me. This should be a large section
4. Add a section of my interests/likes/hobbies/etc. Can probably go in "About Me,"
   otherwise it can be its own section before academics
5. Try to match the design/layout to my personality
6. MORE ANIMATIONS!!
   - Blocks of text are boring. Make it more interesting by using something other than lines to separate.
   - Maybe use more photos inline
