# About Me
I am Jordan Powers, a software engineer currently employed at Raytheon Technologies. I recently
graduated from California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo summa cum laude and
achieved a Bachelor of Science degree in Software Engineering.

# What is this?
This is my personal website. My goal for this page is to introduce myself, demonstrate
some of the cool projects I've worked on, and possibly journal my thoughts. However, it's still a
work-in-progress, so there isn't too much to see right now.
