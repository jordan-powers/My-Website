# About Me
I am Jordan Powers, a software engineer currently employed at Raytheon Technologies. I recently
earned a Bachelors of Science in Software Engineering from California Polytechnic State University
at San Luis Obispo.

# What is this?
This is my personal website. My goal for this page is to introduce myself, demonstrate
some of the cool projects I've worked on, and possibly journal my thoughts. However, it's still a
work-in-progress, so there isn't too much to see right now.
