    <p class="subheading">About Me</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I am a high school senior attending <a class="inline" href="https://lbpoly.schoolloop.com/">Long Beach Polytechnic High School</a>.
       I compete in the <a class="inline" href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">First Robotics Competition</a> as a member of team <a class="inline" href="https://momentum4999.com/wp">Momentum</a>.
      I have a love for programming, and this website is just one example of the sort of projects I complete in my free time.</p>

    <p class="subheading">Projects</p>
    <p class="paragraph">I enjoy programming, and often write code in my free time. Most of what I do gets posted to <a class="inline" href="https://github.com/lost1227">Github</a>.
      I'm also a handy person, and I often fix what breaks around the house. Some examples include how I repair our garden sprinklers, I've patched holes in our plaster, and how I've helped to rebuild our padio deck.
