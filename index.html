    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p>This is my personal website. I'm still working on it, so don't expect
    too much right now. At some point I plan to go into more detail about
    the projects I'm most proud of, but I haven't gotten around to that yet.
    Anyway, the point of this website is less to demonstrate rad web-design skills
    (I am literally just using <a class="subtle" href="https://github.com/kognise/water.css">someone else's</a> css) and more to have a
    convenient domain name.
    </p>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <p>Again, I don't really have much to say here yet,
    but if you want to see some of my projects you should check out my
    <a href="https://github.com/lost1227">github profile</a>.
